Automated Plant Leaf Disease Detection and Classification Using Image Processing and Machine Learning Techniques

Diseases in plants are among the most important reasons for crop losses and low productivity,
especially in the case of farmers who may not have immediate access to experts for early
diagnosis. Most diseases originate from small, usually unnoticed spots or color variations on
leaves, which almost always become visible too late. In order to eliminate this burden, this
project will develop an automated system to classify plant leaf diseases based on an image of
the leaf.
The idea is simple: a leaf photo is given to the system, and with the help of image processing
and machine learning, it can tell whether the leaf is healthy or affected by a particular disease.
It learns from many example images and thereafter uses the acquired knowledge for
recognizing patterns on new leaves. This helps in faster and more accurate detection than
manual checking.
The main aim of the project is to assist farmers by offering them an easy, affordable means,
and fast way of monitoring their crops; thus, they will have the opportunity to identify diseases
at an early stage, take proper action on time, reduce crop loss, and avoid unnecessary use of
pesticides. It also shows that besides the practical application of modern technologies, even a
simple camera and a trained model are enough to make a big difference in agriculture.
